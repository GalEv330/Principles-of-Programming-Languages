Ben Gurion Principles of programming languages course assignments.

Topics
Applied Functional Programming
Benefits of Functional programming (FP): safety, concurrency, asynchronous code
Characteristics of FP: pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, composition
FP in JavaScript: function, map, filter, chain, flatmap, reduce, zip.
Types in TypeScript: incremental typing, basic types, interfaces, contracts
Hierarchical data types: Arrays, objects, JSON
Higher-order procedures
Polymorphic procedures: Generic types
Syntax, Semantics, Types
Concrete and abstract syntax: comparing JavaScript and Scheme
Operational semantics: the substitution model
Types: basic types, composite types, type constructors, algebraic data types
Higher-Order Functions
Functions and the processes they generate
Anonymous functions, closures, lexical scope
Partial evaluation, currying and function composition
Primitive and user-defined procedures, derived expressions, special operators
Abstraction on Data and on Control
Data abstraction: Abstract Data Types (ADTs), Interfaces, Immutable data structures
ADTs and Algebraic Data Types to model abstract syntax
From iterators to streams to observables - push and pull data flow
Control abstraction: Promises and asynchronous programming - reactive programming model
Coroutines: generators, yield, async and await in JavaScript
Continuation passing style programming in Scheme
Tail Recursion Optimization, stack execution model
